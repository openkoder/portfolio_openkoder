## ✨ About This Project

A pixel-perfect, lightning-fast personal portfolio built from scratch using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Not just another portfolio template – this is a fully interactive, cinematic experience for potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

**🔑 Key Features That Set This Portfolio Apart:**

-   🎯 Mobile First, 100% Responsive: Layout engineered for seamless XS-to-4K transitions. Your content, my priority.
-   ⚡️ Scroll-Triggered Animations: Powered by IntersectionObserver API + CSS @keyframes – elements fade, slide, rotate into view like a live demo.
-   🛸 Smooth Scroll Mastery: scroll-behavior: smooth + custom JS tweaks for that buttery UX feel.
-   📱 Cross-Device Dominance: Tested on iPhone 6 – 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy, iPad, MacBook, 4K TVs. Flawless.
-   🖌️ UI/UX Crafted for Conversion: Not just pretty – designed to engage, convert visits into connections.
-   🔒 Future-Proof & Lightweight: 0 dependencies, pure JS/CSS/HTML. <5MB total size. Loads faster than your thoughts.
